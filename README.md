# Translator

This is a simple R function that uses the `httr` library to translate text using the Google Translate API.

## Installation

To use this function, you will need to have the `httr` library installed. You can install it using the following code:

```R
install.packages("httr")
```

## Usage

To translate text, you can use the `translate_text` function. Here is an example:

```R
translate_text("Hello, how are you?", "en", "es")
```

This will translate the text from English to Spanish and return the translated text.

## Example

Here is an example that demonstrates how to use the `translate_text` function:

```R
source_text <- "Hello, how are you?"
source_lang <- "en"
target_lang <- "es"

translated_text <- translate_text(source_text, source_lang, target_lang)
cat("Translated Text:", translated_text, "\n")
```

This will print the translated text:

```
Translated Text: Hola, ¿cómo estás?
```
